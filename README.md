This plugin causes all curly quotes to be highlighted in red.

To fix the curly quote errors, just call :FixQuotes.  By default it
operates on the entire file.  Pass a range (or use V to select some lines)
to restrict the portion of the file that gets fixed.

This plugin is a modification of Scott Bronson's [vim-trailing-whitespace](https://github.com/bronson/vim-trailing-whitespace).
