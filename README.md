This plugin causes all curly quotes to be highlighted in red.

To fix the curly quote errors, just call :FixQuotes.  By default it
operates on the entire file.  Pass a range (or use V to select some lines)
to restrict the portion of the file that gets fixed.

This plugin is a fork of [https://github.com/traviswsims/vim-straight-quotes][traviswsims/vim-straight-quotes] for VIM 9 compatibility.
