This plugin causes all curly quotes to be highlighted in red.

To fix the curly quote errors, just call `:FixQuotes`.  By default it
operates on the entire file.  Pass a range (or use V to select some lines)
to restrict the portion of the file that gets fixed.

This plugin is a fork of [traviswsims/vim-straight-quotes](https://github.com/traviswsims/vim-straight-quotes) to improve compatibility with vim 9.
